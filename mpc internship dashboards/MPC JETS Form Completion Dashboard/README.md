# MPC JETS Form Completion Project  
**2023 MPC Power Delivery Internship**  

## Overview  

The **MPC JETS Form Completion Project** focused on updating and maintaining **DistGIS ArcMap** by processing work orders received from **service personnel and line crews**.  

To streamline updates, I leveraged **GIS tools**, **Excel tracking sheets**, and **Oracle SQL Developer** to ensure accurate edits, additions, and removals of infrastructure data.

## Project Contributions  

- **GIS Data Management & Editing**  
  - Processed **JETS work orders** by adding, modifying, and removing features in **DistGIS ArcMap**.  
  - Used **Excel tracking sheets** to manage work orders, tracking:  
    - **Work order number**  
    - **Date of request**  
    - **Headquarters location (Coast, Meridian, Pinebelt)**  
  - Ensured accurate updates by interpreting work orders and verifying locations.  

- **Workflow Automation & Process Improvement**  
  - Reduced manual processing time and **improved operational efficiency**.  
  - Enhanced **NLC processing accuracy** by maintaining up-to-date infrastructure records.  
  - Increased **team knowledge and understanding** of GIS-based work order completion.  

- **Impact & Results**  
  - Faster and more **efficient completion of work orders**.  
  - Improved **data accuracy** in **DistGIS ArcMap**.  
  - Enhanced **infrastructure visualization** for better decision-making.
