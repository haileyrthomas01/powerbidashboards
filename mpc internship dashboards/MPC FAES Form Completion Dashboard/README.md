# MPC FAES Form Completion Project  
**2023 MPC Power Delivery Internship**  

## Overview  

The **MPC FAES Form Completion Project** focused on updating infrastructure records in **DistGIS ArcMap** based on work orders from service personnel and line crews. With over **5,500 work orders** to complete, this project aimed to **enhance data accuracy, streamline workflow processes, and improve operational efficiency**.  

To manage and track the work orders efficiently, I utilized an **Excel sheet** containing **work order numbers, dates, and headquarters (Coast, Meridian, Pinebelt)**. This dataset helped ensure accurate updates in **DistGIS ArcMap** while improving coordination between teams.
